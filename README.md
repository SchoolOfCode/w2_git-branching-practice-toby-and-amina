# branching-exercise

Find the errors within the HTML page.  

For this task, we would like you to:

First person:

- Clone down this repo
- Create first branch and name 'bugFix1'
- Find an error and fix it 
- Add, commit, and push changes
- Create a pull request 
- Review the error together as a pair
- Merge the code 

Swap to Second Person who will repeat above steps (name branch 'bugFix2').

Once second person has merged their changes, first person will take over again, create a new branch and keep going. 

Continue doing this until all the errors have been fixed and corrected!
